This SDK allows us to create our own diagnostics to help us write proper code that’s being verified against those rules in real-time: you don’t have to perform the verification at a separate build-step. What’s more is that we can combine that with a code fix: a shortcut integrated in Visual Studio that provides us a solution to what we determine to be a problem."}}}]}},pathContext:{tag:"Visual Studio"}}}});
